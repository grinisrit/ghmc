# Quantitative Finance (QUANT)

We are building a derivative pricing library with a strong focus
on the differentiable programming paradigm. We implement efficient 
algorithms for sensitivity analysis of various pricing models 
suitable for fast calibration in realtime trading environments,
and benefiting from GPU acceleration for risk evaluation of large 
trading books. Yet our aim is to avoid as much as possible compromises 
on computational accuracy and underlying dynamics expressiveness needed
in complex modelling set-ups.  

We hope also that our approach will make it easier to integrate pricing 
components directly into algorithmic trading systems and machine learning 
pipelines, as well as portfolio and margin optimisation platforms.

Hands-on tutorials:

* [Introduction: Arbitrage and Risk-Neutral Pricing](introduction.ipynb) - a great place to start 
providing even newcomers with the necessary option pricing background.

* Basic numerical techniques for the [Black-Scholes-Merton model](bsm.ipynb) 

* Calibrating the volatility smile & surface with [stochastic volatility models](vol_calibration.ipynb)

* American Monte-Carlo with AAD with the [LSM algorithm](lsm.ipynb)

* Monte-Carlo pricing with the [Heston model](heston_model.ipynb)
