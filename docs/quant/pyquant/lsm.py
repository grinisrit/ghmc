    Attributes:
        option_price:
            Price of the option at the initial moment of time. Shape: (1, ).
        reg_poly_coefs:
            Polynomial coefficients that were fitted on the regression step.
            Shape: (N_STEPS + 1, REG_POLY_DEGREE + 1). `reg_poly_coefs[0]` and
            `reg_poly_coefs[-1]` are always NaN for the following reasons.
            At the initial moment of time, all paths have the same value, so 
            continuation value can only be calculated for this single point. This
            value is contained in the attribute `initial_cont_value`.
            At the final moment of time, the option is exercised, so continuation
            value is not defined.
        initial_cont_value:
            Continuation value at the initial moment of time. Shape: (1, ).
            At this moment, all paths have the same value, so continuation value
            can only be calculated for this single point.
        reg_x_vals:
            Values of in-the-money subset of underlying paths at each moment of time.
            If there were no ITM paths at some moment of time, the corresponding
            list item will be `None`. Length: N_STEPS + 1.
        reg_y_vals:
            Values of dependent variable for regression for in-the-money
            subset of underlying paths at each moment of time. If there were
            no ITM paths at some moment of time, the corresponding list item
            will be `None`. Length: N_STEPS + 1.

    Notes:
        - `N_STEPS` is the number of time steps in paths of the underlying asset
            which were passed as the argument for `price_american_put_lsm()`
            function.
        - `REG_POLY_DEGREE` is the value of the eponymous argument of
            `price_american_put_lsm()` function.
        - For each index `i`, the tensors `reg_x_vals[i]` and `reg_y_vals[i]`
            have the same length. For explanation of these variables,
            see [Seydel2017], section 3.6.3, algorithm 3.14, item (c).

    """Calculates the price of American put option using the LSM algorithm.

    This is the modification of LSM algorithm where it's divided into two steps:
    1. Regression. Find approximation of continuation value C(S, t) via regression.
    2. Pricing. Use the continuation value from step 1 as a sort of barrier:
       when the payoff for a given path crosses C(S, t), exercise the option on this path.

    Two separate sets of paths are used on each step to reduce the bias. These
    sets may have different number of paths, but they must have the same number
    of time steps.

    Gradient computation is disabled on the regression step.

    Args:
        paths_regression: Paths of underlying asset, starting from the same
            point S0 at initial moment of time. Used on regression step.
        paths_pricing: Paths of underlying asset, starting from the same
            point S0 at initial moment of time. Used on pricing step.
        dt: Time step.
        strike: Option strike price.
        rate: Risk-free rate. Note that the input paths must be generated with
            the same risk-free rate as the value of this parameter.
        reg_poly_degree: Degree of polynomial for regression.
        return_extra: If `True`, in addition to other values return the
            in-the-money points which are used as the data for regression.

    Shape:
        - paths_regression, paths_pricing: (N, M + 1), where N is the number of

        Computation result of LSM algorithm, represented as `LSMResult` object.
        Contains computed option price, polynomial coefficients that were fitted
        on the regression step and continuation value at initial moment of time.
        If `return_extra` is `True`, also contains the in-the-money points which
        were used as the data for regression.
