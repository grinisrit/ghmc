# Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

:warning: This component is under active development.

Our specific interest is in environmental control and survey tasks.
Various industrial processes in geological formations, 
such as carbon dioxide capture sequestration, 
underground energy storage, enhanced oil recovery,
hydraulic fracturing, well disposal,
etc. could present safety and environmental risks 
including groundwater contamination. 
In the case of storage, any leaks would also be detrimental 
for the performance of the capture system.

This activity must be thoroughly monitored 
in order to avoid long-time pollution of freshwater aquifers 
in the subsurface.

This library offers high performance solvers for inverse problems 
arising in monitoring systems based on 
hydro-thermo-mechanical-chemical data,
but also muography, seismic surveys, 
gravimetry or inSAR.
