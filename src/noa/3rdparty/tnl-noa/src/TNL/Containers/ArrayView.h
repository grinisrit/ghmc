/**
 * \brief \e ArrayView is a simple data structure which provides a non-owning
 * encapsulation of array data. That is, \e ArrayView is like \ref Array without
 * memory management.
 *
 * The meaning of the template parameters is the same as in \ref Array.
 *
 * \tparam Value  The type of array elements.
 * \tparam Device The device where the array is allocated. This ensures the
 *                compile-time checks of correct pointers manipulation. It can
 *                be either \ref Devices::Host or \ref Devices::Cuda.
 * \tparam Index  The indexing type.
 *
 * \e ArrayView provides access to array elements and general array operations
 * same as \ref Array, but it does not manage memory. The construction of an
 * \e ArrayView does not make a memory allocation, but it can be _bound_ to an
 * existing portion of memory specified by a raw pointer, another \e ArrayView,
 * or an \e Array. Similarly, \e ArrayView is not resizable, so there is no
 * \e setSize method. Note that \e ArrayView does not _own_ its data, so it does
 * not deallocate it in the destructor.
 *
 * Another important difference between \e ArrayView and \ref Array is in the
 * copy semantics. While the copy-constructor of \e Array makes a deep copy of
 * the data, \e ArrayView makes only a shallow copy in the copy-constructor,
 * i.e. it changes only its pointer and size. As a result, array views can be
 * efficiently _passed by value_ (even to device kernels) or _captured by value_
 * in lambda functions (even in device lambda functions). Note that
 * \ref operator= in both \e ArrayView and \e Array still makes a deep copy of
 * the data.
 *
 * See also \ref Array, \ref Vector, \ref VectorView.
 *
 * \par Example
 * \include Containers/ArrayViewExample.cpp
 * \par Output
 * \include ArrayViewExample.out
