 * \brief Namespace holding segments data structures.
 *
 * *Segments* represent data structure for manipulation with several local arrays (denoted also as segments)
 having different size in general. All the local arrays are supposed to be allocated in one continuos global array.
 The data structure segments offers mapping between indexes of particular local arrays and indexes
 of the global array. In addition,one can perform parallel operations like for or flexible reduction on partical
 local arrays.

 A typical example for use of *segments* is implementation of sparse matrices. Sparse matrix like the following
 \f[
  \left(
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
   1  &  0  &  2  &  0  &  0 \\
    0  &  0  &  5  &  0  &  0 \\
    3  &  4  &  7  &  9  &  0 \\
    0  &  0  &  0  &  0  & 12 \\
   0  &  0  & 15  & 17  & 20
  \end{array}
  \right)
 \f]
 is usually first compressed which means that the zero elements are omitted to get the following "matrix":

 \f[
 \begin{array}{ccccc}
    1  &   2  \\
    5   \\
    3  &   4  &  7 &  9   \\
    12 \\
    15 & 17  & 20
 \end{array}
 \f]
 We have to store column index of each matrix elements as well in a "matrix" like this:
 \f[
 \begin{array}{ccccc}
    0  &   2  \\
    2   \\
    0  &   1  &  2 &  3   \\
    4 \\
    2 & 3  & 4
 \end{array}
 \f]

 Such "matrices" can be stored in memory in a row-wise manner in one contiguous array because of the performance reasons. The
first "matrix" (i.e. values of the matrix elements) would be stored as follows

 \f[
    \begin{array}{|cc|c|cccc|c|cc|} 1 & 2 &  5 & 3 & 4 & 7 & 9 & 12 & 15 & 17 & 20 \end{array}
 \f]

and the second one (i.e. column indexes of the matrix values) as follows

\f[
    \begin{array}{|cc|c|cccc|c|cc|} 0 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 2 & 3 & 4 \end{array}
 \f]

What we see above is so called [CSR sparse matrix
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_(CSR,_CRS_or_Yale_format)). It is the most popular
format for storage of sparse matrices designed for high performance. However, it may not be the most efficient format for
storage of sparse matrices on GPUs. Therefore many other formats have been developed to get better performance. These formats
often have different layout of the matrix elements in the memory. They have to deal especially with two difficulties:

1. Efficient storage of matrix elements in the memory to fulfill the requirements of coalesced memory accesses on GPUs or good
spatial locality for efficient use of caches on CPUs.
2. Efficient mapping of GPU threads to different matrix rows.

Necessity of working with this kind of data structure is not limited only to sparse matrices. We could name at least few others:

1. Efficient storage of [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) - one segment represents one graph
node, the elements in one segments are indexes of its neighbors.
2. [Unstructured numerical meshes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_mesh) - unstructured numerical mesh is a graph in
fact.
3. [Particle in cell method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-in-cell) - one segment represents one cell, the elements in
one segment are indexes of the particles.
4. [K-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) - segments represent one cluster, the elements
represent vectors belonging to given cluster.
5. [Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02900) - segments are particular rows of the hash table, elements in segments
corresponds with coliding hashed elements.

In general, segments can be used for problems that somehow corresponds wit 2D data structure where each row can have different
size and we need to perform miscellaneous operations within the rows. The name *segments* comes from segmented parallel
reduction or [segmented scan (prefix-sum)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmented_scan).

The following example demonstrates the essence of *segments* in TNL:

\includelineno Algorithms/Segments/SegmentsExample_General.cpp

We demonstrate two formats of segments - \ref TNL::Algorithms::Segments::CSR and \ref TNL::Algorithms::Segments::Ellpack running
on both CPU and GPU (lines 58-76). For each of them, we call function `SegmentsExample` which first creates given segments (line
18). The segments are defined by the sizes of particular segments.

Next we allocate array with data related to the segments (line 24). The number of elemets managed by the segments is given by
\ref TNL::Algorithms::Segments::CSR::getStorageSize and \ref TNL::Algorithms::Segments::Ellpack::getStorageSize respectively.

Next we setup the segments elements (lines 29-33) by calling \ref TNL::Algorithms::Segments::CSR::forAllElements
(and \ref TNL::Algorithms::Segments::CSR::forAllElements respectively) which iterates over all elements of the segments
in parallel and perform given lambda function. The lambda function receives index of the segment (`segmentIdx`),
index of the element within the segment (`localIdx`), index of the element within the array `data` and a reference to boolean
(`compute`) which serves as a hint for interrupting the iteration over the elements of given segment when it is set to `false`.
The value of the elements having the local index smaller or equal to the segments index is set to the value of the segment
index. It creates, in fact, lower triangular matrix elements of which have values equal to row index.

Next we use a function \ref TNL::Algorithms::Segments::printSegments to print the content of the segments (lines 38-39). To do
this we have to provide a lambda function `fetch` (line 38) which returns value of elements with given global index.

Finally we show how to compute sum of all elemnts in each segment. Firstly, we create vector into which we will store the sums
(line 44) and get its view (line 45). The size of the vector is given by the number of the segments which can be obtained by the
means of the method \ref TNL::Algorithms::Segments::CSR::getSegmentsCount (and \ref
TNL::Algorithms::Segments::Ellpack::getSegmentsCount respectively). The sums are computed using the method \ref
TNL::Algorithms::Segments::CSR::reduceAllSegments (and \ref TNL::Algorithms::Segments::Ellpack::reduceAllSegments respectively)
which works the same way as the flexible parallel reduction (\ref TNL::Algorithms::reduce). It requires lambda functions
`fetch` for reading the data related to particular elements of the segments, function `reduce` which is \ref std::plus in this
case and a function `keep` to store the result of sums in particular segments.

The result looks as follows:

\include SegmentsExample_General.out

Note that the Ellpack format manages more elements than we asked for. It is because some formats use padding elements for more
efficient memory accesses. The padding elements are available to the user as well and so we must ensure that work only with
those elements we want to. This is the reason why we use the if statement on the line 31 when setting up the values of the
elements in segments. The padding elements can be used in case when we later need more elements than we requested. However, the
segments data structure does not allow any resizing of the segments. One can change the sizes of the segments, however, the
access to the originally managed data is becoming invalid at that moment.
