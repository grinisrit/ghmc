 * \brief \e reduce implements [(parallel) reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduce_(parallel_pattern))
 * for vectors and arrays.
 *
 * Reduction can be used for operations having one or more vectors (or arrays)
 * elements as input and returning one number (or element) as output. Some
 * examples of such operations can be vectors/arrays comparison, vector norm,
 * scalar product of two vectors or computing minimum or maximum. If one needs
 * to know even the position of the smallest or the largest element, the
 * function \ref reduceWithArgument can be used.
 *
 * \tparam Device parameter says on what device the reduction is gonna be performed.
 * \tparam Index is a type for indexing.
 * \tparam Result is a type of the reduction result.
 * \tparam Fetch is a lambda function for fetching the input data.
 * \tparam Reduction is a lambda function performing the reduction.
 *
 * \e Device can be on of the following \ref TNL::Devices::Sequential,
 * \ref TNL::Devices::Host and \ref TNL::Devices::Cuda.
 *
 * \param begin defines range [begin, end) of indexes which will be used for the reduction.
 * \param end defines range [begin, end) of indexes which will be used for the reduction.
 * \param fetch is a lambda function fetching the input data.
 * \param reduction is a lambda function defining the reduction operation.
 * \param identity is the [identity element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element)
 *                 for the reduction operation, i.e. element which does not
 *                 change the result of the reduction.
 * \return result of the reduction
 *
 * The `fetch` lambda function takes one argument which is index of the element to be fetched:
 *
 * ```
 * auto fetch = [=] __cuda_callable__ ( Index i ) { return ... };
 * ```
 *
 * The `reduction` lambda function takes two variables which are supposed to be reduced:
 *
 * ```
 * auto reduction = [] __cuda_callable__ ( const Result& a, const Result& b ) { return ... };
 * ```
 *
 * \par Example
 *
 * \include ReductionAndScan/SumExample.cpp
 *
 * \par Output
 *
 * \include SumExample.out
