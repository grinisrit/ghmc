/**
 * \brief Computes segmented scan (or prefix sum) on a vector.
 *
 * Segmented scan is a modification of common scan. In this case the sequence of
 * numbers in hand is divided into segments like this, for example
 *
 * ```
 * [1,3,5][2,4,6,9][3,5],[3,6,9,12,15]
 * ```
 *
 * and we want to compute inclusive or exclusive scan of each segment. For inclusive segmented prefix sum we get
 *
 * ```
 * [1,4,9][2,6,12,21][3,8][3,9,18,30,45]
 * ```
 *
 * and for exclusive segmented prefix sum it is
 *
 * ```
 * [0,1,4][0,2,6,12][0,3][0,3,9,18,30]
 * ```
 *
 * In addition to common scan, we need to encode the segments of the input sequence.
 * It is done by auxiliary flags array (it can be array of booleans) having `1` at the
 * beginning of each segment and `0` on all other positions. In our example, it would be like this:
 *
 * ```
 * [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0, 0, 0]
 * [1,3,5,2,4,6,9,3,5,3,6,9,12,15]
 *
 * ```
 *
 * \tparam Device parameter says on what device the reduction is gonna be performed.
 * \tparam Type parameter says if inclusive or exclusive is scan is to be computed.
 *
 * See \ref SegmentedScan< Devices::Host, Type > and \ref SegmentedScan< Devices::Cuda, Type >.
 *
 * **Note: Segmented scan is not implemented for CUDA yet.**
